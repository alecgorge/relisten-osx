/**
 `AFNetworkActivityIndicatorManager` manages the state of the network activity indicator in the status bar. When enabled, it will listen for notifications indicating that a network request operation has started or finished, and start or stop animating the indicator accordingly. The number of active requests is incremented and decremented much like a stack or a semaphore, and the activity indicator will animate so long as that number is greater than zero.
 
 You should enable the shared instance of `AFNetworkActivityIndicatorManager` when your application finishes launching. In `AppDelegate application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` you can do so with the following code:
 
 [[AFNetworkActivityIndicatorManager sharedManager] setEnabled:YES];
 
 By setting `isNetworkActivityIndicatorVisible` to `YES` for `sharedManager`, the network activity indicator will show and hide automatically as requests start and finish. You should not ever need to call `incrementActivityCount` or `decrementActivityCount` yourself.
